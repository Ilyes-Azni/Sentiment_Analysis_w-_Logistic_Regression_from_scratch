# Sentiment_Analysis_Tweeter

I wanted fort this project to experiment sentiment analysis. I used some tweets data to draw polarities and get to train the model to discover wether it's positive, negative or neutral. This project is kind of an experiment, I'm pushing further on the other Sentiment Analysis project I have on my github. Even though it's not finshed yet, I'm pretty sure that the end will be great.

Good read!
