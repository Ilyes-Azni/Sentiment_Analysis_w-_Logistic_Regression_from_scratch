# Sentiment_Analysis_Tweeter

I wanted fort this project to experiment sentiment analysis. I used some tweets data to draw polarities and get to train a logistic regression model to discover wether it's positive, negative or neutral. This project is kind of an experiment, I'm pushing further on the other Sentiment Analysis project I have on my github. Even though it's not finshed yet, I'm pretty sure that the end will be great.

Good read!
