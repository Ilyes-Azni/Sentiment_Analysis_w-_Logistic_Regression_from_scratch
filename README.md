# Sentiment_Analysis_Tweeter

I wanted fort this project to experiment sentiment analysis. I used some tweets data to draw polarities and get to train a logistic regression model to discover wether it's positive, negative or neutral. Actually this project is also a way for me to understand how a ML algorithm work.  As opposed to my previous (and future I guess) projects, I don't just use a sk-learn model (which is absolutely fine). In that case I built my very own Linear regression algorithm to understand what is lying beneath  the " from sklearn import LogisticRegressor ". That is actually the real point of this one... 

Good read!
